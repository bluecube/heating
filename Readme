This repository contains experiments with new heating controller system we have at home.

The only thing that might be interesting for other people is a python library for reading
registers from PLCs using db net protocol over UDP.
Although db net over UDP is password protected this implementation doesn't need the password
for reading at all and can bruteforce it from a single recorded message (slowly).

No docs, sorry.
